  summary: 'This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to both R and Python. It implements
    fast hierarchical, agglomerative clustering routines. Part of the functionality
    is designed as drop-in replacement for existing routines: linkage() in the SciPy
    package ''scipy.cluster.hierarchy'', hclust() in R''s ''stats'' package, and the
    ''flashClust'' package. It provides the same functionality with the benefit of a
    much faster implementation. Moreover, there are memory-saving routines for clustering
    of vector data, which go beyond what the existing packages provide. For information
    on how to install the Python files, see the file INSTALL in the source distribution.'
